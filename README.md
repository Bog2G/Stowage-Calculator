# Stowage-Calculator
This is a project from my university.

Run from MainCalc.exe or MainCalc.py on every exercise page there there is an explanation how to approach the exercise. You will need an Draught table for the interpolations, a example one is uploaded on here.



It's a calculator for draught , displacement and max cargo that can be loaded in the future more exercises will be added as well as a better GUI( maybe for the GUI)

I used Tkinter for the GUI because of the accesability it provides for begginers.
